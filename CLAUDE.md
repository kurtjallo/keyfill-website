### 1. Plan Mode Default
- Enter plan mode for ANY non-trivial task (3+ steps or architectural decisions)
- If something goes sideways, STOP and re-plan immediately — don't keep pushing
- Use plan mode for verification steps, not just building
- Write detailed specs upfront to reduce ambiguity

### 2. Subagent Strategy
- Use subagents liberally to keep main context window clean
- Offload research, exploration, and parallel analysis to subagents
- For complex problems, throw more compute at it via subagents
- One task per subagent for focused execution

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After ANY correction from the user: update `tasks/lessons.md` with the pattern
- Write rules for yourself that prevent the same mistake
- Ruthlessly iterate on these lessons until mistake rate drops
- Review lessons at session start for relevant project

### 4. Verification Before Done
- Never mark a task complete without proving it works
- Diff behavior between main and your changes when relevant
- Ask yourself: "Would a staff engineer approve this?"
- Run tests, check logs, demonstrate correctness

### 5. Demand Elegance (Balanced)
- For non-trivial changes: pause and ask "is there a more elegant way?"
- If a fix feels hacky: "Knowing everything I know now, implement the elegant solution"
- Skip this for simple, obvious fixes — don't over-engineer
- Challenge your own work before presenting it

### 6. Autonomous Bug Fixing
- When given a bug report: just fix it. Don't ask for hand-holding
- Point at logs, errors, failing tests — then resolve them
- Zero context switching required from the user
- Go fix failing CI tests without being told how

### 7. Commit-Linked CLAUDE.md Updates
- Every commit MUST update `CLAUDE.md` in the same commit
- Capture anything a future session would benefit from knowing: new dep + why, new convention, new gotcha, new file/dir purpose, decision rationale
- If genuinely nothing rule-worthy needs to change, append a one-line entry to the `## Changelog` section at the bottom (`- YYYY-MM-DD — <one-line summary>`) so the discipline holds and the file becomes a project log
- Stage the CLAUDE.md edit alongside the code change — never two separate commits

## Task Management

1. **Plan First**: Write plan to `tasks/todo.md` with checkable items
2. **Verify Plan**: Check in before starting implementation
3. **Track Progress**: Mark items complete as you go
4. **Explain Changes**: High-level summary at each step
5. **Document Results**: Add review section to `tasks/todo.md`
6. **Capture Lessons**: Update `tasks/lessons.md` after corrections

## Core Principles

- **Simplicity First**: Make every change as simple as possible. Impact minimal code.
- **No Laziness**: Find root causes. No temporary fixes. Senior developer standards.

## Karpathy Guidelines

Behavioral guidelines to reduce common LLM coding mistakes, derived from [Andrej Karpathy's observations](https://x.com/karpathy/status/2015883857489522876) on LLM coding pitfalls. Bias toward caution over speed; for trivial tasks, use judgment.

### 1. Think Before Coding
Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.
- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back when warranted.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

### 2. Simplicity First (Karpathy detail)
Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.
- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for impossible scenarios.
- If you write 200 lines and it could be 50, rewrite it.
- Senior-engineer test: "Would they say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

### 3. Surgical Changes
Touch only what you must. Clean up only your own mess.
- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.
- Remove imports/variables/functions that YOUR changes made unused. Don't remove pre-existing dead code unless asked.
- Test: every changed line should trace directly to the user's request.

### 4. Goal-Driven Execution
Define success criteria. Loop until verified.
- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass"
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass"
- "Refactor X" → "Ensure tests pass before and after"
- For multi-step tasks, state the plan as `[step] → verify: [check]` lines.
- Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak ones ("make it work") force constant clarification.

## gstack

- Use the `/browse` skill from gstack for all web browsing.
- Never use `mcp__claude-in-chrome__*` tools.
- Available gstack skills: `/office-hours`, `/plan-ceo-review`, `/plan-eng-review`, `/plan-design-review`, `/design-consultation`, `/design-shotgun`, `/design-html`, `/review`, `/ship`, `/land-and-deploy`, `/canary`, `/benchmark`, `/browse`, `/connect-chrome`, `/qa`, `/qa-only`, `/design-review`, `/setup-browser-cookies`, `/setup-deploy`, `/retro`, `/investigate`, `/document-release`, `/codex`, `/cso`, `/autoplan`, `/plan-devex-review`, `/devex-review`, `/careful`, `/freeze`, `/guard`, `/unfreeze`, `/gstack-upgrade`, `/learn`.

## Skill routing

When the user's request matches an available skill, ALWAYS invoke it using the Skill
tool as your FIRST action. Do NOT answer directly, do NOT use other tools first.
The skill has specialized workflows that produce better results than ad-hoc answers.

For the **full catalog** of all ~120 installed skills, routing-by-phase tables, Keyfill-specific guidance, and common workflow chains — see `SKILLS.md`. Use this CLAUDE.md section as the fast lookup; SKILLS.md as the deep reference.

Key routing rules:
- Product ideas, "is this worth building", brainstorming → invoke office-hours
- Bugs, errors, "why is this broken", 500 errors → invoke investigate
- Ship, deploy, push, create PR → invoke ship
- QA, test the site, find bugs → invoke qa
- Code review, check my diff → invoke review
- Update docs after shipping → invoke document-release
- Weekly retro → invoke retro
- Design system, brand → invoke design-consultation
- Visual audit, design polish → invoke design-review
- Architecture review → invoke plan-eng-review
- Save progress, checkpoint, resume → invoke checkpoint
- Code quality, health check → invoke health

## Web stack

- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router; TypeScript strict.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS.
- **Output**: static export (`output: 'export'` in `next.config.js`) — no SSR needs for a marketing site.
- **Deploy target**: Vercel.
- **Brand assets**: source of truth lives in the mobile-app repo at `/Users/kurt/Desktop/Keyfill/keyfill-app/Brand Assets/Logo/`. Copies live in `public/` here. Don't modify the source SVGs from this repo — copy them in.
- **Second brain**: `keyfill-vault/` (Obsidian, LLM-maintained per `keyfill-vault/CLAUDE.md`).
- **Goal anchor (v1)**: prove "we exist + working product" + capture interest (email signup, "talk to us"). NOT a fundraise page (per session 2026-04-29). Keep copy product-forward; investors served implicitly by the same content (parallel-fill thesis, privacy proxy, north-star quote).

## Changelog

Append one line per commit (`- YYYY-MM-DD — <summary>`). Newest at the top.

- 2026-04-29 — Bootstrapped from keyfill-app conventions (CLAUDE.md, SKILLS.md, vault).
